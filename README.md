# java.4444.VoidException
When I was developing Minecraft 1.2.5 in another world line, I tried to add a variant of Herobrine, "HeroVoid", as a joke. However, the moment I added and executed the mob, an error called ``java.4444.VoidException'' appeared, and the PC I was developing on suddenly stopped booting.
